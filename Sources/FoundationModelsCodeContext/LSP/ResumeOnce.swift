/// - `PendingRequestTable` wraps every registered continuation in one of these, keyed by JSON-RPC
///   request id, because a request's real response (`resolveOrBuffer(id:response:)`) and its
///   timeout (`resolve(id:with:)`) can both fire for the same id.
/// - `ProcessInstallRunner` (`ServerInstaller.swift`) uses one directly for a single continuation,
///   racing a process's natural exit (`Process.terminationHandler`) against an install timeout.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` is safe because every access goes through `lock`.
